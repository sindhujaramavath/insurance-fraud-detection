üõ°Ô∏è Auto Insurance Fraud Detection System
Project Description
The Auto Insurance Fraud Detection System is a machine learning-based application developed to help insurance companies, such as Progressive Auto Insurance, proactively identify potentially fraudulent auto claims before they are processed. The system reduces financial loss, minimizes manual claim reviews, and improves overall operational efficiency.

This project is implemented using Python, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Pandas, and AWS SageMaker for deployment and monitoring.

Project Objectives
Detect fraudulent insurance claims with high accuracy.

Automate fraud flagging to reduce manual checks.

Increase precision to minimize false positives.

Improve trust with stakeholders using explainable results and dashboards.

Dataset
Source: Internal insurance claims + external vehicle & telematics data

Format: Structured CSV

Features: claim_time, claim_amount, police_report_available, driver_risk_score, etc.

Target: fraud_reported (binary classification)

Steps Taken
1. Data Collection
5 years of historical claims and vehicle data.

Data sources: SQL, Telematics logs, third-party APIs.

2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
python
Copy
Edit
df['claim_amount'] = df['claim_amount'].fillna(df['claim_amount'].mean())
Handled missing values

Categorical encoding

Outlier removal

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Identified time-based fraud patterns (e.g., late-night claims)

Correlation between claim size and missing documentation

4. Feature Engineering
suspicious_time_flag

high_value_no_docs_flag

multiple_claims_flag

5. Model Development
python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from xgboost import XGBClassifier

model = XGBClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
Models Used: Random Forest, XGBoost

Tuning: GridSearchCV, Cross-Validation

Handling Imbalance: SMOTE

6. Evaluation Metrics
Metric	Value
Accuracy	87%
Precision	91%
Recall	83%

7. Deployment
Hosted using AWS SageMaker

Integrated into claims processing system via API

Real-time scoring pipeline

8. Monitoring
Used AWS CloudWatch for live tracking

Built executive dashboards in Power BI

Outcomes
‚úÖ 25% more fraudulent claims detected

‚úÖ 40% fewer manual claim reviews

‚úÖ Improved resolution time for genuine customers

Challenges
Class Imbalance: Only 2% of data labeled as fraud ‚Üí used SMOTE.

OCR Processing: Extracted metadata from scanned police reports.

Stakeholder Trust: Conducted A/B testing with manual investigators.

How to Run Locally
bash
Copy
Edit
python src/fraud_detection.py
Deployment Steps (AWS SageMaker)
Convert model to .pkl using joblib

Upload to S3

Create SageMaker Endpoint

Integrate endpoint into claims platform backend

Version History
v1.0 - June 2025 - Initial public release

v1.1 - July 2025 - Integrated retraining and updated risk features
